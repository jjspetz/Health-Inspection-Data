### Hackathon Challenges
Problem: We built a back-end for our site but were not able to connect our server to our domain correctly
Solution: We temporaryly solved this by using Google Fusion Tables and javascript but this has left our project less responsive and currently it does not work on mobile.


### Going Forward
We want to fully utilize our back end to handle all searches and filtering, and add alternative search features. We may also looking into filtering out map by neighborhood.
