# Houston-Hackathon

## Do I Want to Eat There
It's a web app that displays a map of houston restuatants and lets you check if they have passed their last health inspection.

### Technology
Javascript
HTML/CSS
Django
Postgres
Google Fusion Tables

### Challenges
1. We built a back-end for our site but were not able to connect our server to our domain correctly
- We temporaryly solved this by using Google Fusion Tables and javascript but this has left our project useless on mobile


### Going Forward
We want to finish our backend and add alternative search features. We are also looking into filtering out map by neighborhood.
