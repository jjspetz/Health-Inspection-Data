    <h3>About Our Web App</h3>
    <p>
      This web app originally started as a project for the Houston Civic Hackathon.
      JJ Spetseris and Ryan Leon have continued to work on the project afterward
      to give it some much needed improvements.<br><br>
      The project was built with Django and has a Postgres database, but due to time
      constraints, we are currently using Google Fusion Tables to populate our map
      with over 17,000 points of data. The map displays each establishment's latest
      inspection results from 2015 and 2016, and is color coded for quick reference.
      <br><br>
      We used JavaScript to give users their current filter options, which include
      searching by establishment name and filtering out passes and/or fails. Going
      forward we would like to use our database to automatically update our
      fusion tables with new data, though challenges persist in synchronizing Fusion Tables to an existing SQL database.
